;Program information
;  Program name: Arrays of floating point numbers
;  Programming languages: Two modules in C, four in x86, one in C++, and one in bash
;  Date program began: 2024-Mar-8
;  Date of last update: 2024-Mar-17
;  Files in this program: main.c, manager.asm, input_array.asm, compute_mean.asm, isfloat.asm,
;  output_array.c, compute_variance.cpp, r.sh.
;  Testing: Alpha testing completed.  All functions are correct.
;  Status: Ready for release to customers
;
;Purpose
;  This program takes floating point number inputs from the user and puts them in an array. The array
;  values are then printed, along with the variance of the numbers.
